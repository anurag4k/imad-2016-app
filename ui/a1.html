Light travels faster than sound. That's why some people appear bright until you hear them speak.</li>
<li>The moment poverty walks in through the door, love and peace toss themselves out of the window.</li>
<li>The only place where success comes before work is dictionary!</li>
<li>Whatever you are today is the result of your past actions. Every decision matters. You are responsible for your life and have the complete authority to make it or break it.<br></li>
<br>Life is unfair. Don't moan. Don't complain. Learn to be thick skinned. Make the most of what you can.
<br>Its not about how hard you can hit. Its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
<br>You can't litter negativity everywhere and wonder why you have a trashy life.
<br>Over thinking ruins you. It ruins the situation, twists things around, makes you worry about futile questions and makes everything much worse than actually it is.
<br>Not everyone will make it to your future. Some people are passing through to teach you lessons in life.
<br>Never trust a person that has seriously let you down more than two times. Once was the warning, twice was a lesson and anything beyond that is simply taking advantage. (This is my personal opinion. You may choose to differ.)
<br>If you write a person "I Love You" and they reply you back with an emoji (No matter what that emoji is) they don't love you back.
<br>Dress to impress.
<br>Don't be emotionally attached to anyone. People change. Even your besties may probably turn into strangers one day.
<br>Just because you miss someone doesn't mean you need them back in your life. Missing is a part of getting over.
<br>Time heals everything.
<br>Your parents are your greatest assets. Respect and cherish them.
<br>What others think of you is not your problem. Numbers don't define you. Numbers like marks, money, number of cars, houses etc. Not all human attributes and characteristics (like honesty, humility, courage etc.) can be defined by numbers. People out there judging you, make their life simple by comparing you on the basis of numbers.
<br>Learn to let go, even if you are right.
<br>Smile. You don't own all the problems in the world.
<br>Eventually all pieces will fall into place. Until then laugh at the confusion, live in the moment and know that everything happens for a reason.
